## Drawing:
[[delete_node_in_a_linked_list.excalidraw]]

## solution explanation:
if we dont given a head of linked list we can simply shift to the left by one node, so next of cur head is will be dropped cause we dont have another links pointing to it, so cur head becomes next, next will be droped, and cur head will be pointing towards next.next
